# Advent of Code 2021 – The Kirby version

Another year, another [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)! As is a tradition at this point, together with a few friends over at the [Kirby discord](https://chat.getkirby.com/), we've decided to solve the puzzles together.

Their language of choice is Javascript, because I have no idea why, and I'm solving the puzzles in PHP. It started as a pure PHP version, but then I thought to myself: "fuck it, I might as well", and remade it as a [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) site.

The code is open at [Github](https://github.com/adamkiss/aoc21.adamkiss.com), so everyone can browse the code, roll eyes at my extremely dirty CSS, or learn something about Kirby.

## Friends

This is the complete list of Github repositiories, since we've all opened the repositiories with the solutions to public.

## Try this site out locally
Since the Advent of Code authors asked the participants to not share their inputs, the inputs in this site are added as a submodule from private repo (which is _a pain in the ass_). Anyway, if you want to try the code, you'll need to provide your own inputs.

They are located in the `/site/inputs` directory, and are PHP files that return your specific input in the same shape as is the demo input for the relevant day, e.g. `array` of `integers` for the day 01.
