# Advent of Code 2021 – The Kirby version

Another year, another [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)! As is a tradition at this point, together with a few friends over at the [Kirby discord](https://chat.getkirby.com/), we've decided to solve the puzzles together.

Their language of choice is Javascript, because I have no idea why, and I'm solving the puzzles in PHP. It started as a pure PHP version, but then I thought to myself: "fuck it, I might as well", and remade it as a [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) site.

The code is open at [Github](https://github.com/adamkiss/aoc21.adamkiss.com), so everyone can browse the code, roll eyes at my extremely dirty CSS, or learn something about Kirby.

## Friends

This is the complete list of Github repositiories, since we've all opened the repositiories with the solutions to public.

## Try this site out locally

There will be a way, but I have to figure out and program the inputs first.
